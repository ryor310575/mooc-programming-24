# Please write a program which asks the user for a password.
# The program should then ask the user to type in the password again.
# If the user types in something else than the first password,
# the program should keep on asking until the user types the first password again correctly.
#
# Have a look at the expected behaviour below:
#
# Sample output
# Password: sekred
# Repeat password: secret
# They do not match!
# Repeat password: cantremember
# They do not match!
# Repeat password: sekred
# User account created!
password=input("Password: ")
