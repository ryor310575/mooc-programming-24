# Some say paying taxes makes Finns happy, so let's see if the secret of happiness
# lies in one of the taxes set out in Finnish tax code.
#
# According to the Finnish Tax Administration, a gift is a transfer of property to
# another person against no compensation or payment. If the total value of the gifts
# you receive from the same donor in the course of 3 years is €5,000 or more, you must pay gift tax.
#
# When the gift is received from a close relative or a family member, the amount of tax
# to be paid is determined by the following table:
#
# Value of gift	        Tax at the lower limit	    Tax rate for the exceeding part (%)
# 5000 — 25000	        100	                        8
# 25000 — 55000	        1700	                    10
# 55000 — 200000	    4700	                    12
# 200000 — 1000000	    22100	                    15
# 1000000 —	            142100	                    17

# So, for a gift of 6000 euros the recipient pays a tax of 180 euros (100 + (6000 - 5000) * 0.08).
# Similarly, for a gift of 75 000 euros the recipient pays a tax of 7100 euros (4700 + (75000 - 55 000) * 0.12).
#
# Please write a program which calculates the correct amount of tax for a gift from a close relative.
# Have a look at the examples below to see what is expected. Notice the lack of thousands separators
# in the input values - you may assume there will be no spaces or other thousands separators in the
# numbers in the input, as we haven't yet covered dealing with these.
#
# Sample output
# Value of gift: 3500
# No tax!
#
# Sample output
# Value of gift: 5000
# Amount of tax: 100.0 euros
#
# Sample output
# Value of gift: 27500
# Amount of tax: 1950.0 euros
