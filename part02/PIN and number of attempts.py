# Please write a program which keeps asking the user for a PIN code until they type in the correct one,
# which is 4321. The program should then print out the number of times the user tried different codes.
#
# Sample output
# PIN: 3245
# Wrong
# PIN: 1234
# Wrong
# PIN: 0000
# Wrong
# PIN: 4321
# Correct! It took you 4 attempts
#
# If the user gets it right on the first try, the program should print out something a bit different:
#
# Sample output
# PIN: 4321
# Correct! It only took you one single attempt!
attempts=0
while True:
    pin = input("PIN: ")
    attempts+=1
    if pin=="4321":
        if attempts==1:
            print("Correct! It only took you one single attempt!")
            break
        else:

            break
