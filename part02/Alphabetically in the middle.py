# Please write a program which asks the user for three letters.
# The program should then print out whichever of the three letters
# would be in the middle if the letters were in alphabetical order.
#
# You may assume the letters will be either all uppercase, or all lowercase.
#
# Some examples of expected behaviour:
#
# Sample output
# 1st letter: x
# 2nd letter: c
# 3rd letter: p
# The letter in the middle is p
#
# Sample output
# 1st letter: C
# 2nd letter: B
# 3rd letter: A
# The letter in the middle is B
char_1=input("1st letter: ")
char_2=input("2nd letter: ")
char_3=input("3rd letter: ")

# if char_1 > char_2:
#     print("great is Char_1")
# if char_2 > char_1:
#     print("great is Char_2")
