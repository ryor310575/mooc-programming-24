# Please write a program which asks the user to type in a limit.
# The program then calculates the sum of consecutive numbers (1 + 2 + 3 + ...)
# until the sum is at least equal to the limit set by the user.
# The program should function as follows:
#
# Sample output
# Limit: 2
# 3
#
# Sample output
# Limit: 10
# 10
#
# Sample output
# Limit: 18
# 21
#
# If you have trouble understanding how the desired output is calculated,
# the sample outputs in the next exercise may help. You may assume the number
# typed in by the user is always equal to 2 or higher.

while suma<limit:
