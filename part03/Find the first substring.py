# Please write a program which asks the user to type in a string and a single character.
# The program then prints the first three character slice which begins with the character
# specified by the user. You may assume the input string is at least three characters long.
# The program must print out three characters, or else nothing.
#
# Pay special attention to when there are less than two characters left in the string
# after the first occurrence of the character looked for. In that case nothing should
# be printed out, and there should not be any indexing errors when executing the program.
#
# Sample output
# Please type in a word: mammoth
# Please type in a character: m
# mam
#
# Sample output
# Please type in a word: banana
# Please type in a character: n
# nan
#
# Sample output
# Please type in a word: tomato
# Please type in a character: x
#
# Sample output
# Please type in a word: python
# Please type in a character: n
word=input("Please type in a word: ")
character=input("Please type in a character: ")
char_position=word.find(character)
# print(f"Word Length: {len(word)} Char Positions: {char_position}")
if char_position+3<=len(word) and char_position>=0:
    slice_word=word[char_position:char_position+3]
    print(slice_word)
