# Please write a program which asks the user for two strings and then prints
# out whichever is the longer of the two - that is, whichever has the more characters.
# If the strings are of equal length, the program should print out "The strings are equally long".
#
# Some examples of expected behaviour:
#
# Sample output
# Please type in string 1: hey
# Please type in string 2: hiya
# hiya is longer
#
# Sample output
# Please type in string 1: howdy doody
# Please type in string 2: hola
# howdy doody is longer
#
# Sample output
# Please type in string 1: word1=input("Please type in string 1: ")
# word2=input("Please type in string 2: ")
# if len(word1)>len(word2):
#     print(f"{word1} is longer")
# elif len(word1)<len(word2):
#     print(f"{word2} is longer")
# else:
#     print("The strings are equally long")hey
# Please type in string 2: bye
# The strings are equally long

word1=input("Please type in string 1: ")
word2=input("Please type in string 2: ")
if len(word1)>len(word2):
    print(f"{word1} is longer")
elif len(word1)<len(word2):
    print(f"{word2} is longer")
else:
    print("The strings are equally long")
